Project : introduce to data science

Dataset : kaggle

Process Project :

- We start by taking the data from the kaggle and then check the data if there is an abnormal value or not.
- Then clean the data of the abnormal values ​​and do EDA to bring the analysis 
- We analyze data from viewing EDA.
- After that, we do Future Engineering by extracting the colume with the same value in the column into values ​​that are 0 and 1.
- After that we do modeling (classification) using randomforestclassifier algorithm.
- Then we get modeling and do the ensemble, finally we check accuracy.
